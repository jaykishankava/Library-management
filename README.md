Library Management System - React Application
Project Overview
This project is a Library Management System built using React.js. The application allows users to add, view, edit, and delete books with details such as the title, author, publication date, genre, borrow/return status, and an image. It provides a seamless user interface for managing a library's book records, ensuring that book data is stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage.

Features
Add Books: Users can add new books by filling out a form that includes:

Title
Author
Publication Date
Genre
Borrow/Return Status
Upload an image of the book cover
View Books:

Display a list of all added books in a card format.
Each card shows the bookâ€™s title, author, genre, date, and borrow/return status.
Books can be filtered and searched based on the title, author, date, genre, or borrow/return status.
Edit Book:

Users can update any book's details, including the image, by navigating to an edit page.
Delete Books:

Users can remove books from the list, and the system will update the stored data accordingly.
LocalStorage Management:

All books are stored in the browser's LocalStorage, ensuring data persistence across sessions without the need for a backend.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Notifications: Toast notifications are displayed to inform the user about the success of actions (e.g., adding, editing, or deleting a book).

Technologies Used
React.js: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
React-Router: Used for navigation between different pages (home, add book, edit book).
React Toastify: Provides toast notifications for user actions.
LocalStorage: Stores books data persistently in the browser.

Future Enhancements
Pagination: Implement pagination for large book lists.
Backend Integration: Connect the app to a backend database for more robust data management.
Authentication: Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own book lists.
Conclusion
This library management app provides a clean and user-friendly interface for handling book records. With its local data storage capabilities and easy-to-use forms, it is ideal for managing a small personal or community library.
